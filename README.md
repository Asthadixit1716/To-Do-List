## 📌 About the Project

This project was developed as a personal initiative to strengthen core front-end skills and contribute to my developer portfolio. It reflects my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and data persistence in the browser using `localStorage`.

The To-Do List supports:

- ✅ Task creation and deletion
- 🗑️ Removing individual or all tasks
- 💾 Saving tasks between sessions
- 📱 Fully responsive design

> This project is beginner-friendly and ideal for those looking to understand how interactive web apps work using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—no frameworks.
